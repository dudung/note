I would like to
1. surf with the wave instead of avoid it or stand against it,
2. have more me time to do reflection,
3. be more as supporting team instead of as leader,
4. learn from the scratcth any inadequate knowledge,
5. write more and talk less, put idea and suggestion into writing,
6. walk more and start to run, also the other type of sports,
7. blog more serious and consistent here,
8. learn some programming languages by maintaining repositories,
9. eat more healthy foods,
10. collaborate with more colleagues with mutualism paradigm,
11. fight administrative barriers and self-obstacles for the professorship.
